# Customer-Segmentation-Project---RFM-and-GMM
This GitHub project focuses on customer segmentation based on purchase patterns, utilizing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM), and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The project is divided into two main files: "Data Analysis" and "Data Cleaning.


1.RFM Segmentation:Leveraging the RFM framework, customers are segmented based on their purchase behavior, considering Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values. Average revenue per customer is used as a more relatable metric, providing a meaningful representation of customer segments.

2.GMM Implementation: Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is employed for further segmentation, enhancing the clustering accuracy. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are utilized to determine the optimal number of clusters and confirm the robustness of the identified segments.


3.Data Files: 

a.Data Analysis: This file contains the main analysis and segmentation using RFM and Average Revenue. It provides insights into customer behavior based on the established segments.
b.Data Cleaning: This file focuses on preprocessing and cleaning of the data, ensuring that the input for analysis is accurate and reliable.




By combining RFM for initial segmentation and GMM for fine-tuning, this project aims to provide a comprehensive and accurate customer segmentation model. The use of Average Revenue per customer enhances the interpretability and relatability of the segmentation results.
